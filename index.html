    <p>When I find myself in times of trouble<br>
    Mother Mary comes to me<br>
    Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.<br>
    And in my hour of darkness<br>
    She is standing right in front of me<br>
    Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.<br></p>

    <p><i>Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.<br>
    Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.</i></p>

    <p>And when the broken hearted people<br>
    Living in the world agree,<br>
    There will be an answer, let it be.<br>
    And though they may be parted there is<br>
    Still a chance that they will see<br>
    There will be an answer, let it be.<br></p>

    <p><i>Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.<br>
    Yeah there will be an answer, let it be.</i></p>

    <p><i>Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.<br>
    Yeah there will be an answer, let it be.</i></p>

    <p>And though the night is cloudy,<br>
    There is still a light that shines on me,<br>
    Shine until tomorrow, let it be.<br>
    O, will I make up to the sound of music<br>
    Mother Mary comes to me<br>
    Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.<br></p>

    <p><i>Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be,<br>
    Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.</i></p>

    <p><i>Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be,<br>
    Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.</i></p><br>
